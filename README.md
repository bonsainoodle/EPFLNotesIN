# EPFL notes from an(other) IN student

## Motivation

This project follows on from Joachim Favre's work on taking notes of EPFL courses in the IN section.

To understand the meaning and ambition of this project, I invite you to read the README of his repository: https://github.com/JoachimFavre/EPFLNotesIN/

Since I'm convinced that you can only progress if you know all the tools at your disposal, I think it's crucial to know your course. That's why I've decided to take Joachim's notes and shorten them to keep only the essentials (in my opinion). These documents are not intended to replace courses (and therefore Joachim's notes), as they are free of any demonstrations, examples and remarks. They are to be considered as a revision aid and a summary of what you should ideally know. Joachim's notes are an exceptional work that go far beyond simple note-taking and contain many personal remarks that deal with intuitions about concepts or more rigorous ways of getting to certain results. For these reasons, I strongly advise you to read his notes entirely before reading these.

## Disclaimer

This project is the result of students' work and does not claim to be perfect, nor to replace courses. It is possible that some errors have slipped into the notes or that programs have changed. If you find any, please report them by opening an issue on the repository.

## Progress

So far, only the BA1 courses have been shortened.
