% \subsection{GCD and LCM}
% \parag{Definition of GCD}{
%     Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, not both zero. The largest integer $d$ such that $d \divides a$ and $d \divides b$ is called the \important{greatest common divisor} (GCD) of $a$ and $b$. It is denoted by $\gcd\left(a, b\right)$.
% }

% \parag{Example}{
%     We have: 
%     \[\gcd\left(24, 36\right) = 12, \mathspace \gcd\left(17, 22\right) = 1\]
% }

% \parag{Definition of relatively prime}{
%     The integers $a$ and $b$ are \important{relatively prime} if $\gcd\left(a, b\right) = 1$.

%     The integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are \important{pairwise relatively prime} if $\gcd\left(a_i, a_j\right) = 1$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq n$.
% }

% \parag{Example}{
%     We can verify that $10, 17$ and $21$ are pairwise relatively prime: 
%     \[\gcd\left(10, 17\right) = 1, \mathspace \gcd\left(10, 21\right) = 1, \mathspace \gcd\left(17, 21\right) = 1\]

%     However, 10, 19 and 24 are not pairwise relatively prime since: 
%     \[\gcd\left(10, 24\right) = 2 \neq 1\]
% }

% \parag{Finding the GCD}{
%     Let's write $a$ and $b$ as their prime factorisation: 
%     \[a = p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_n^{a_n}, \mathspace b = p_1^{b_1}\cdot p_2^{b_2}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_n^{b_n}\]
%     where each exponent is a nonnegative integer. We can compute the GCD the following way:
%     \[\gcd\left(a, b\right) = p_1^{\min\left(a_1, b_1\right)} p_2^{\min\left(a_2, b_2\right)} \cdot\ldots\cdot p_n^{\min\left(a_n, b_n\right)}\]

%     However, finding the prime factorisation of a number is a very complicated problem. It is not polynomial (and this is the basis of many cryptography algorithm).
% }

% \parag{Definition of LCM}{
%     The \important{least common multiple} (LCM) of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$. It is denoted by $\lcm\left(a, b\right)$.

%     We can also find it using prime factorisations: 
%     \[\lcm\left(a, b\right) = p_1^{\max\left(a_1, b_1\right)} \cdot p_2^{\max\left(a_2, b_2\right)} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{\max\left(a_n, b_n\right)}\]
% }

% \parag{Example}{
%     Let's find the prime factorisation of 120 and 500: 
%     \[120 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1, \mathspace 500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3 = 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^3\]

%     Then: 
%     \[\gcd\left(120, 500\right) = 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1 = 4\cdot 5 = 20\]
%     \[\lcm\left(120, 500\right) = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^3 = 8\cdot 3\cdot 125 = 3000\]
% }


% \parag{Theorem}{
%     Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Then: 
%     \[a\cdot b = \gcd\left(a, b\right) \cdot \lcm\left(a, b\right)\]

%     \subparag{Proof}{
%         This proof relies on the fact that: 
%         \[a + b = \max\left(a, b\right) + \min\left(a, b\right)\]

%         Thus: 
%         \begin{multiequality}
%          & \gcd\left(a, b\right)\lcm\left(a,b\right)  \\
%          =\ & \left(p_1^{\min\left(a_1, b_1\right)}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_n^{\min\left(a_n, b_n\right)}\right)\left(p_1^{\max\left(a_1, b_1\right)}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_n^{\max\left(a_n, b_n\right)}\right)  \\
%          =\ & p_1^{\min\left(a_1, b_1\right)} p_1^{\max\left(a_1, b_1\right)} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{\min\left(a_n, b_n\right)}p_n^{\max\left(a_n, b_n\right)} \\
%          =\ & p_1^{\min\left(a_1, b_1\right) + \max\left(a_1, b_1\right)} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{\min\left(a_n, b_n\right) + \max\left(a_n, b_n\right)}  \\
%          =\ & p_1^{a_1 + b_1} \cdot \ldots p_n^{a_n + b_n} \\
%          =\ & p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_1^{b_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{a_n}\cdot p_n^{a_n} \\
%          =\ & p_1^{a_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{a_n} \cdot p_1^{b_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{b_n} \\
%          =\ & a \cdot b    
%         \end{multiequality}

%     }
% }

% \parag{Observation}{
%     If we have $a > b$ and $r = a \Mod b$, then: 
%     \[\gcd\left(a, b\right) = \gcd\left(r, b\right)\]

%     Indeed, we know that $r = a \Mod b$ is equivalent to $a = q\cdot b + r$. We want to show that: 
%     \[d \divides a \text{ and } d \divides b \iff d \divides b \text{ and } d \divides r\]

%     First, let's suppose that $d \divides a$ and $d \divides b$. Divisibility preserves addition, so 
%     \[d \divides a - qb = r \implies d \divides r\]

%     Now, let's suppose that if $d \divides r$ and $d \divides b$: 
%     \[d \divides q \cdot b + r = a \implies d \divides a\]

%     So, we have indeed shown that: 
%     \[d \divides a \text{ and } d \divides b \iff d \divides b \text{ and } d \divides r\]
% }

% \parag{Example}{
%     Let's say we want to compute $\gcd\left(287, 91\right)$: 
%     \[\gcd\left(287, 91\right) = \gcd\left(14, 91\right) = \gcd\left(91, 14\right) = \gcd\left(7, 14\right) = \gcd\left(14, 7\right) = \gcd\left(0, 7\right) = 7\]

%     Indeed, using long division we can see that: 
%     \[287 = 3\cdot 91 + 14\]
%     \[91 = 6\cdot 14 + 7\]
%     \[7 = 2\cdot 7 + 0\]

%     x := a
%     y := b
%     while y != 0
%         r := x mod y
%         x := y
%         y := r
%     return x

% procedure gcd_recursive(a > b: positive integers)
%     if b == 0 then return a
%     else return gcd(b, a mod b)
% \end{filecontents*}


% \parag{Euclidean algorithm}{
%     This algorithm is called the Euclidean algorithm (it was invented by Euclid). Iteratively, it is written:
%     \importcode{euclideanAlgorithmIterative.code}{pseudo}

%     Recursively, it looks much simpler:
%     \importcode{euclideanAlgorithmRecursive.code}{pseudo}

%     \subparag{Proof}{
%         Let's say we want to compute $\gcd\left(a, b\right)$. So, we can take $r_0 = a$ and $r_1 = b$. 

%         Then, we perform a division and we get $r_2 = r_0 \Mod r_1$. Clearly, $r_1 > r_2 \geq 0$.

%         Similarly, taking $r_3 = r_1 \Mod r_2$, then $r_2 > r_3 \geq 0$.

%         Since $r_i > r_{i+1} \geq 0$, then $r$ decreases at least by 1 at each step, so there must be a step at which it is equal to 0. Let's call this $r_{n+1} = r_{n-1} \Mod r_n$, where $r_{n+1} = 0$. Then: 
%         \[\gcd\left(a, b\right) = \gcd\left(r_0, r_1\right) = \ldots = \gcd\left(r_{n-1}, r_{n}\right) = \gcd\left(r_n, 0\right) = r_n\]
%     }
% }

% \parag{Lamé's theorem}{
%     Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers with $a \geq b$. 

%     The number of divisions used by the Eucliden algorithm to find $\gcd\left(a, b\right)$ is less than or equal to five times the number of decimal digits in $b$. 

%     In other words, the Euclidean algorithm has a complexity of $O\left(\log b\right)$ (careful, it is a big-$O$, not a big-$\Theta$).
% }

% \subsection{More facts about number theory (not in the exam)}

% \parag{Distribution of primes}{
%     Let's define $\pi\left(x\right)$ be the number of primes not exceeding $x$.

%     The prime number theorem states that the following function approaches 1 as $x$ tends toward infinity:
%     \[\frac{\pi\left(x\right)}{\mathspace \frac{x}{\ln\left(x\right)} \mathspace}.\]

%     This implies that the odds that a random positive integer less than $n$ is prime are approximately of:
%     \[\frac{1}{\ln\left(x\right)}.\]
% }

% \parag{Primes and arithmetic progressions}{
%     We wonder if there are long arithmetic progressions made up entirely of primes. For example, the following one consists of five primes: 
%     \[5, 11, 16, 23, 29\]

%     We can also find one of ten primes: 
%     \[199, 409, 619, 820, 1039, 1249, 1459, 1669, 1879, 2089\]

%     In the 1930s, Paul Erdös conjectured that for every positive integer $n > 1$, there is an arithmetic progression of length $n$ made up entirely of primes. This was proven 70 years later, in 2006, by Ben Green and Terrence Tau.
% }

% \parag{Mersene primes}{
%     Prime numbers of the forme $2^p - 1$, where $p$ is prime, are called Mersene primes.

%     For example, the following numbers are Mersene primes. 
%     \[2^2 - 1 = 3, \mathspace 2^3 - 1 = 7, \mathspace 2^5 - 1 = 37, \mathspace 2^7 - 1 = 127\]

%     However, all numbers of this form are not primes, for example the following number isn't prime (so it isn't a Mersene prime):
%     \[2^{11} - 1 = 2047 = 23\cdot 89\]

%     The advantage of such primes is that there exists a very efficient way to verify whether numbers of the form $2^p - 1$ are primes. Thus, the largest primes nowadays are Mersene primes. In mid 2018, the largest known prime --- which has 25 million decimal digits --- was: 
%     \[2^{82\,589\,933} - 1\]
% }

% \parag{Goldbach's Conjecture}{
%     In 1742 Goldbach conjectured that every even integer $n > 2$ is the sum of two primes.

%     It has been verified by computer for all positive integers up to $1.6 \cdot 10^{18}$, but no one has found a proof yet. 
% }

% \parag{The Twin Prime Conjecture}{
%     We define twin primes to be a pair of primes that differ by 2. For example: 
%     \[3,5 \mathspace 5,7 \mathspace 11, 13 \mathspace\]

%     It is conjectured that there are infinitely twin primes.

%     In 2018, the largest twin primes we found --- which have $388\,342$ decimal digits --- are: 
%     \[2\,996\,863\,034\,895 \cdot 2^{1\,290\,000} \pm 1\]

\section{Counting}
\subsection{Basic rules}

\parag{Product rule}{
    Let $A$ and $B$ be two tasks, with respectively $n_1$ and $n_2$ ways to do them.

    There are $n_1 \cdot n_2$ ways to do both tasks.
}

\parag{Counting Cartesian product}{
    Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m$ be finite sets.

    We have that:
    \[\left|A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n\right| = \left|A_1\right|\cdot \left|A_2\right| \cdot \ldots \cdot \left|A_n\right|\]
}

\parag{Sum rule}{
    Let $A$ and $B$ be two tasks, with respectively $n_1$ and $n_2$ ways to do them.

    If none of the set of $n_1$ ways is the same as any of the set of $n_2$ ways, then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do task $A$ or $B$.
}

\parag{Sum rule in terms of set}{
    Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets, meaning $A \cap B = \o$, then we know that:    \[\left|A \cup B\right| = \left|A\right| + \left|B\right|\]

    This is the sum rule phrased in term of sets.

    More generally, if we have $n$ sets $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ such that $A_i \cap A_j = \o$ for all $i, j$, then:
    \[\left|A_1 \cup \ldots \cup A_n\right| = \left|A_1\right| + \ldots + \left|A_n\right|\]

}

\parag{Subtraction rule}{
    If a task can be done either in one of $n_1$ ways or in one of $n_2$ ways, then the total number of ways to do the task in $n_1 + n_2$ minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways.

    This is also known as the \important{principle of inclusion-exclusion}:
    \[\left|A \cup B\right| = \left|A\right| + \left|B\right| - \left|A \cap B\right|\]
}

\subsection{Permutations and combinations}
\parag{Definition of permutations}{
    A \important{permutation} of a set of $n$ distinct objects is an \textit{ordered} arrangement of these objects. An ordered arrangement or $r$ elements of a set is called an \important{$r$-permutation}. We note this $P\left(n, r\right)$.
}

\parag{Theorem (counting the number of permutations)}{
    Let $n$ be a positive integer and $r$ be an integer, where $1 \leq r \leq n$.

    The number of $r$-permutations of a set with $n$ distinct elements is given by:
    \[P\left(n, r\right) = n\left(n-1\right)\cdot\ldots\cdot\left(n - r + 1\right)\]

    \subparag{Corollary}{
        We have that:
        \[P\left(n, r\right) =  n\cdot\ldots\cdot\left(n - r + 1\right) = \frac{n!}{\left(n - r\right)!}\]

    }
}

\parag{Definition of combinations}{
    An \important{$r$-combination} of elements of a set (which contains $n$ elements) is an \textit{unordered} selection of $r$ elements from the set. Thus, an $r$-combination is simply a subset of the set with $r$ elements. This number is denoted:
    \[C\left(n, r\right) \text{ or } \binom{n}{r}\]

    We read the second one ``$n$ choose $r$''.
